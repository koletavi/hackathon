Project Goal:	Floading Detection and Warning System

Using Serbo we simulate a spining turbine emulating water flow, we use a sensor to calculate the Flow Rate 
We send this data to a server that deduces if there is a risk of fload and send warnings to the citzens of the relevent area

hackathon.ino - and arduino code describing both turbine and sensor behavior
